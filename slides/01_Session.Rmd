# Pharmacokinetics (PK) / Toxiccokinetics (TK)

.font125[
- The study of the movement of chemicals in and out of the body (“what the body does to the chemical”)

- **ADME** process

.center[

**A**bsorption - How will it get in?

**D**istribution - Which tissue organ it will go?

**M**etabolism - How is it broken down and transformation?

**E**limination - How it leave the body?
]

- Kinetics: rates of change

- <font color="red">PK is focus on .bolder[TIME (t)] and .bolder[CONCENTRATION (C)]</font color>

]

# Absorption

## Exposure routes

- Inhalation – alveolar gas exchange
- Oral – gut absorption
- Dermal –permeation through skin

## Movement of chemical into the body
- **Rate of absorption** (how quickly does it absorb?)
- **Fraction of absorption** (how percentage does it absorb?)

</br>

.bolder[Bioavailability] ia a key factor for substance becomes available to the target tissue after administration.

---

# Distribution

.font125[
- Transfer of the chemical between general circulation and tissues

- Important toxicologically because tissue concentration drives toxicity

- Factors affecting tissue distribution
  - **Blood flow** to tissues
  
- Tissue distribution (For chemicals that rapidly diffuse through membranes) 
  - Assume rapid equilibrium between blood and tissue   
  - Ratio is the tissue:blood **partition coefficient**   
    (Partition coefficient = Concentration in tissue / Concentration in blood)
  - Delivery to tissue limited by blood flow (“flow-limited”).

# Metabolism/transformation

- Enzyme systems, etc. covered in separate class.  
  - Phase I – conversion to more polar metabolite, e.g., oxidation by P450
  - Phase II – conjugation with an endogenous substrate to increase solubility, e.g., GSH conjugation, glucuronidation

- Key issues relevant to risk assessment
  - What are the metabolites?  
  - In what tissues does metabolism occur?
  - What are the rates of metabolism?  
  - What is known about interspecies and intraspecies differences?

- Metabolism process
  - First order kinetics (linear; constant)
  - Michaelis-Menten Kinetics (Non-linear; concentration dependent)

- Identifying the toxicologically active agent(s)

- Providing a basis for extrapolating from experimental studies to humans

- Characterizing how humans may vary in their response to exposure due to differences in internal dose

# GNU MCSim

.font75[

- The project started by Don Maszle and [Frederic Y. Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Y._Bois) in UC Berkeley, 1991. It is written in standard C language as a model preprocessor. 
- First public release in 1993 (straight simulations with Monte Carlo modeling).

> GNU MCSim is a general purpose modeling and simulation program which can performs "standard" or "Markov chain" Monte Carlo simulations. It allows you to specify a set of **linear or nonlinear algebraic equations** or **ordinary differential equations**. They are solved numerically using parameter values you choose or parameter values sampled from statistical distributions. Simulation outputs can be compared to experimental data for Bayesian parameter estimation (model calibration).

# Types of Simulation

**Simple simulation**  
- Straight simulations (set parameter values and initial conditions).

**Used to:** *Model testing when building the model (e.g., mass balance)*

<hr>

**Monte Carlo simulations**  
- Perform repeated (stochastic) simulations across a randomly sampled region of the model parameter space.

**Used to:** *Check possible simulation (under given parameter distributions) results before model calibration*

<hr>

**SetPoints simulation**   
- Solves the model for a series of specified parameter sets. You can create these parameter sets yourself or use the output of a previous Monte Carlo or MCMC simulation.

**Used to:** *Posterior analysis, Local/global sensitivity analysis*

# Types of Simulation

### Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
- Performs a series of simulations along a Markov chain in the model parameter space. 
- They can be used to obtain the Bayesian <font color="red">**posterior**</font> distribution of the model parameters, given a statistical model, <font color="blue">**prior**</font> parameter distributions and data for which a **likelihood function** can be computed. 
- *GNU MCSim* can handle hierarchical statistical models as well.

# A General PBTK Model

- Exposures are absorbed from gut lumen.

- Blood flows move the chemical throughout the body. The total blood flow to all tissues equals the cardiac output.

- Some tissues (e.g. arterial blood) are simple compartments, while others (e.g. kidney) are compound compartments consisting of separate blood and tissue sections with constant partitioning (i.e., tissue specific partition coefficients).

- Some specific tissues (lung, kidney, gut, and liver) are modeled explicitly, others (e.g. fat, brain, bones) are lumped into the “Rest of Body” compartment.

- The only ways chemicals “leaves” the body are through metabolism (change into a metabolite) in the
liver or excretion by glomerular filtration into the proximal tubules of the kidney (which filter into the lumen of the kidney).

# GNU Overview

The *GNU MCSim* consists in two pieces, a **model generator** and a **simulation engine**:

<hr>

The model generator, **"mod"**

- Created to facilitate structural model definition and maintenance, while keeping execution time short. You can code your model using a simplified syntax and use mod to translate it to `C` (`model.c`).


The simulation engine, **"sim"**

- A set of routines which are linked to your model during compilation to produce executable program (`mcsim.model`). After that, you can run simulations of your model under a variety of conditions, specify an associated statistical model, and perform simulations.

# Comments on style

### For your model file to be **readable** and **understandable**.

- All variable names begin with a capital letter followed by meaningful lower case subscripts.
- Where two subscripts are necessary, they can be separated by an underscore, such as in `PC_fat`.
- Where there is only one subscript an underscore can still be used to increase readability as in `Q_fat`.
- Where two words are used in combination to name one item, they can be separated visually by capitalizing each word, as in `BodyWt`.

# Tips of MCSim under R(Studio)

Generally, the GNU MCSim used `.model` and `.in` as the extension to name the model- and input-file. However, RStudio doesn't support the syntax highlight for these extensions. You can add `.R` as the extension for these files to help you edit your model or input in RStudio with syntax highlighting. Also, it can help you format your code in the code bracket.

# Summary

- Role of pharmacokinetics in risk assessment 
  - toxicity is driven by concentration at the target tissue site.

- Basic pharmacokinetics  
  - A,D,M,E each may affect internal dose, and differences between species or among individuals.

- Pharmacokinetic modelling  
  - Information from physiology and chemistry are common ways to characterize the concentration-time relationship.

- Computational toolkits  
  - The open soure computational tools (e.g., R & GNU MCSim) are powerful and can help us conduct the model simulation and data analysis

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 1: Exploratory data analysis

- Now, we have a theophylline PK dataset. The purpose of this exercise is to develop the simple PK model and use it to describe the PK of theophylline. First, look into the theophylline dataset. The `Theoph` data frame has 132 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. Then, find the Cmax and Tmax for each individual. 

```{R}
head(Theoph)
```

- Plot the pharmacokinetic diagram for each individual.

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 2: Model development

- Develop the non compartment model and compartment model in R and MCSim


- Non compartment model

$$C(t) = \frac{F\cdot D \cdot ka}{V(k_a - k_e)}\cdot(\mathrm{e}^{-k_et}-\mathrm{e}^{-k_a{t}})$$

- Compartment model

$$\frac{dA_{gut}}{dt}=-k_aA_{gut}$$

$$\frac{dA}{dt}=k_aA_{gut}-k_eA_e$$
$$C=A/V$$

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 3: Parameter setting and simulation

- Extract the chemical information from httk package
```r
library(httk)
parms <- httk::parameterize_1comp(chem.name = "theophylline")
```

- Use the parameters in the developed model and conduct the simulation 
- Compare the difference between data and the model simulation result (Cmax, Tmax)

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 4: Developing the PBPK model

- Instead of simple PK model, in this exercise we want to apply the well developed PBPK model for 1,3 butadiene.

- First, reproduce the simulation result from the published paper*.
